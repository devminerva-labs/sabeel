              and post-prayer adhkar.

              Ramadan after Ramadan passes with sincere intentions and little to show for
              them. The Quran sits untouched after the second week. The adhkar are remembered
              some mornings and forgotten most. The prayers are logged in the mind but not
              truly accounted for.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Sabeel exists because accountability, even private accountability, changes
              behavior. Seeing that seven juz remain on day twenty creates urgency that
              good intentions alone do not. Seeing that morning adhkar has been completed
              twelve days running creates the momentum to complete it on the thirteenth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The scholars of the ummah have written at length about the virtue of structure
              in worship. The Companions did not approach Ramadan casually. They prepared
              months in advance. They completed the Quran multiple times. They gave every
              night its due. Sabeel is an attempt to make that level of structure accessible
              to an ordinary person with an ordinary life.

              this month and this book is not incidental. It is foundational. Every year,
              Jibreel (peace be upon him) would descend and review the entire Quran with

              the greatest urgency. It is the first matter that will be examined on
